/// The crashes `NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler` never sees.
///
/// [SentoriCrashHandler] catches an `NSException`, which is what
/// Objective-C throws. Almost nothing a Swift app dies of is one. A
/// force-unwrapped nil, an array index out of range, an overflowing
/// arithmetic operator — every one of those is a runtime trap, which
/// arrives as `EXC_BREAKPOINT` / `SIGTRAP`, and the app disappeared
/// with no report at all. A bad pointer is `SIGSEGV`, a `fatalError`
/// or a failed C assert is `SIGABRT`. These are the crashes a mobile
/// team actually has.
///
/// ## Why a signal handler and not a crash library
///
/// A host app may already have one. Whoever installs a handler last
/// wins, and a reporting SDK that takes the handler away from the
/// customer's own reporter has made their failure ours — the one
/// thing the zero-cost rule forbids. So this chains: the previous
/// handler is kept and called, and the signal is re-raised with the
/// default disposition so the OS still sees the death and writes its
/// own report.
///
/// ## Why a binary record
///
/// A handler runs on a process that is already dying, where `malloc`
/// may hold a lock the crashing thread took. Anything that allocates
/// can deadlock, and a crash reporter that hangs the process is worse
/// than one that misses the crash. So the handler does the smallest
/// possible thing — `backtrace` into a buffer reserved at install
/// time, `write` it to a path built at install time — and the next
/// launch, where allocation is safe again, turns it into an event.
