/// `SentoriReplayCapture.captureWireframe` reads the view hierarchy,
/// which only the main thread may do, so when called from elsewhere it
/// does `DispatchQueue.main.sync`. A timer scheduled on the main
/// queue would therefore dispatch to the queue it is already running
/// on and wait for itself — the app freezes, and the freeze is our
/// fault in a product whose entire pitch is that it costs the host
/// nothing. So the timer lives on its own serial queue and blocks
/// there, where blocking costs nobody a frame.
