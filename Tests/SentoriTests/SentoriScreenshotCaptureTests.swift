// Phase 42 sub-E.10 — XCTest coverage for SentoriScreenshotCapture.
//
// Run via Xcode (target → SentoriTests, ⌘U) or via xcodebuild from
// the iOS host:
//   xcodebuild test \
//     -scheme SentoriTests \
//     -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
//
// We can't drive a real key window in a unit-test target (UIScene
// isn't connected), so each assertion below targets the helpers
// against a synthesized UIView hierarchy. The full crash-time flow
// (window→JPEG→base64→event JSON) is covered by the manual smoke
// step (E.11): trigger a real NSException in the example app and
// confirm the dashboard's "Captured at error" gallery fills in.
